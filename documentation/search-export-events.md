### Search Export Events

The intent of this is to search all the events that occured on a player.
For example everything for a particular user, or maybe status, etc.
This should follow the same approach that was doen for searching players

#### Examples of Events
* When a member (player, staff, etc) is added to the system
* When a email is sent
* When a email is opened
* When a form is viewed, updated, submitted, exported
* When a failed email is detected
* etc...

My recommonedation is that you user the livewire-datatables project

I would use the [Intermediate View](https://livewire-datatables.com/intermediate) it has search, export. show/hide already.   It is also livewire compatible.
